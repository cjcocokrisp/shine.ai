- Gather images of your hunt both shiny and not shiny.
- It is best if these images are from in-game of the spot where the hunt would take place.
- Just a few images will not cut it you probably want around 40 of non shiny and shiny. 
  You can use cheats or save edits to force the shiny encounter to get screenshots.
- If the hunt takes place in an area that is effected by the time of day, get pictures at all times of the day.
- If the pokemon can have multiple different poses during an animation where the screenshot may be get screenshots of those poses. 
  You never know how connection latency may effect screenshot time so being prepared for all cases is the best.
- With a shiny that is very similar to the original you may need to increase the number of epoches.
  Epoches are the amount of times that the model sees the data.
- Test data is very important you want to make sure your model works right lol. 
- If you notice that the model is doing good for one type and not the other train more on that other type.
